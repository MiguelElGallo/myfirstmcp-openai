# Simple FastMCP AZD Template

The most basic FastMCP "hello world" application as an AZD template ready for Azure App Service. Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rq9WrZaD9U) for a walkthrough of what it does.

## Usage

1. Clone Repo, go to the folder, Install AZD and run the following command to initialize the project.

```bash
azd init
```

This command will prompt you for the following information:

- `Environment Name`: This will be used as a prefix for the resource group that will be created to hold all Azure resources. This name should be unique within your Azure subscription.

  1. Login to your Azure account.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

  2. Run the following command to build a deployable copy of your application, provision the template's infrastructure to Azure and also deploy the application code to those newly provisioned resources.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```

This command will prompt you for the following information:

- `Azure Location`: The Azure location where your resources will be deployed.
- `Azure Subscription`: The Azure Subscription where your resources will be deployed.

> NOTE: This may take a while to complete as it executes three commands: `azd package` (builds a deployable copy of your application), `azd provision` (provisions Azure resources), and `azd deploy` (deploys application code). You will see a progress indicator as it packages, provisions and deploys your application.

3. Then make changes to app.py and run `azd deploy` again to update your changes.

## Notes

This uses the F1 (free) SKU for app service, which has limited CPU and RAM resources.

See the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/pricing/calculator/) for details on paid SKUs replace the SKU option with a suitable choice.

## Client

Using any MCP client and connect to: <https://yourapp.azurewebsites.net/sse>

The server also includes the MCP inspector, which is a web interface to inspect the MCP messages. You can access it at: (<http://yourapp.azurewebsites.net/#resources>)
